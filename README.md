Controls:

Set CPM: you can enter a value to change the speed of the song. 

Volume: changes the volume of the whole song using the slider - unfortunately gets a bit crunchy. Other methods I tried were not changing the volume correctly. Still works though, but not ideal.

Reverb: Add reverb to the whole song using the slider, default is 0.5, can turn it off by putting it at 0.

Instrument volume and on/off switches: Unfortunately not working as intended (I tried.). But they will update according to instruments added and removed from the text input. For them to be properly added you need to ensure there is a space after the colon. For example "drums: " will show but "drums:" will not.

Song code was just the one provided, but I removed a few things that were conflicting with the way my code processing works (comments at the bottom etc)
